Previously, a lower court had ruled that the charter schools didn't meet enough criteria to be considered state actors, but the 4th circuit ruled that they did. 

SCOTUS declined the appeal of that decision without comment, which essentially means they think the 4th circuit ruled correctly that charter schools which receive public funds are state actors. That could have implications for other rulings around charter schools in the future."

I never imagined so much of my time would be spent fighting literal Nazis.  The tactics they use are straight from Hitler’s playbook.

The ONLY thing that gives me slight hope is the way Georgia responded.  Not the state, but the people. Georgians did not stay quiet about this.

I am not black, I am not Hispanic, I am not gay, I am not Asian, and so forth.  But I will ALWAYS stand up for those issues of equality because it’s the morally right thing to do.  As Jewish people, we are outnumbered constantly and if we do not speak up for injustices to others than who will help speak up for us?

This isn’t my opinion, it’s my culture: tikkun olam has come to refer to the pursuit of social justice or ""the establishment of Godly qualities throughout the world"" based on the idea that ""Jews bear responsibility not only for their own moral, spiritual, and material welfare, but also for the welfare of society at large"".

Second, Every medical or research clinic I worked at required redundant alarm systems. 1) local alarms on the fridge / freezer 2) wi-fi alarms which transmits alerts to certain individuals phones or emails. once that breaker flipped an alert would have been sent and calls to investigate may have prevented the loss. 

Also, we had back up generators for power outage (or red outlet), and standby coolers with ice packs or dry to keep contents at required temp.

Even with all the above aside, the importance of the situation seems to dictate either a sign on all power cut offs to the freezer (breaker included) or more responsible would have been to wait and discuss or call to talk to all individuals expected to have access.

Prosecutors don't bring charges that aren't likely to stick and Mr. McDonald got saved by past history of two of the officers involved.  Don't argue with cops.  Don't give cops excuses to make things worse for you.  Follow even if you think the orders are unlawful and talk with a lawyer after.  Don't try to represent yourself in court.

Full version - 

This is likely an unpopular opinion but...

Looking at this legally, it starts with the officer saying he was on his way to a call when Mr. McDonald stopped him by tapping on his window.  If this is true, just like misusing 911, that can be illegal.  This is only compounded by the arguably pointless question Mr. McDonald posed further delaying.  Mr. McDonald's right to speak, or use a phone like with misusing 911, doesn't absolve him from possibly illegal conduct.

Looking at this practically, this should have resulted in the officer asking for Mr. McDonald's identification for a potential citation.  Instead, it seems the officer went directly hands on.  Something I'd argue is an excessive use of force. There seems to be little call for the cuffs or placement in the back of the squad let alone the physical altercation itself.

There doesn't seem to be video of the fingerprinting.  Neither side disagrees that force was used but the question is whether or not the force used was appropriate.  If fingerprinting before being taken to a holding facility is standard practice, which is questionable, then it becomes a he-said-he-said whether Mr. McDonald fought with the officers.  Remember, that even if you are given illegal orders, every lawyer will suggest that you follow the orders and take it up with the courts later.  You do not want to give officers any excuse to justify their misconduct, or worse, escalate it.

And to not do this.

>Mr. McDonald represented himself in his criminal case.

Mr. McDonald was lucky that two of the officers involved in his arrest have issues that the prosecutor apparently didn't want brought up in court.  If he had been arrested by officers who didn't have anything on record but were similarly overly aggressive he'd probably have a lot worse of an outcome.",Grown men still wanting new images for their young school girl fantasies

My first question was why does the university not have a remote alert with a person responsible for the freezer?

When I was in the Navy we had a remote temperature alert for our vaccination freezer and fridge. If it was out of temp, it would alert anyone with the app installed on their phone which was simply the duty phone, but it could have been a dozen people who had access and the app installed.

And this was the NAVY which is generally ten to twenty years behind in tech.

If they had $1 *million* in stuff in that freezer, why wouldn't they have a remote alert for staff or campus security?
